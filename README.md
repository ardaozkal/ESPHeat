This project includes sample source code for Wemos D1 minis running DHT11 and SHT30 to upload the data to an InfluxDB instance using wifi. You might need to install libraries and boards separately. 

**PLEASE EDIT ALL THE `//SETUP:` LINES ON ARDUINO FILES BEFORE DEPLOYING TO BOARD!**

This project also includes 3 `.json` files which you can use with Grafana to display the data.

**PLEASE READ THE README.MD ON GrafanaFiles FOLDER BEFORE USING THE .JSON FILES**
